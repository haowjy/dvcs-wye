Acceptance Test
Level 2: add, commit, checkout

Test 2.a

$touch new_file.txt
$touch new_file2.txt

$[executable_path] add new_file.txt
$[executable_path] commit first
$[executable_path] commit another
    -> checkpoint: questionable behavior if this commit is successful
$[executable_path] add new_file2.txt
$[executable_path] commit second
$[executable_path] log
    -> get [prev_commit_id] for commit w/ msg "first" 
$[executable_path] checkout [prev_commit_id] new_branch

TEST_RESULT: {
    pass: WD only has new_file.txt and doesn't have new_file2.txt;
    fail: any failed checkpoints, new_file2.txt still exists, any other added or missing files from wd
}


Test 2.b
(this test is to follow 2.a and assumes the same WD and REPO condition after passing 2.a)
$[executable_path] checkout main
    -> checkpoint: fail new_file2.txt is not back in WD
$mkdir new_dir 
$cd new_dir
$touch new_file.txt
$touch new_file2.txt

$[executable_path] add new_file.txt
    -> checkpoint: could fail since repo is in parent dir
$cd ..
$[executable_path] add new_dir/new_file2.txt
$[executable_path] commit 2b


TEST_RESULT: {
    pass: all commands successful, wd has {
        new_file.txt, 
        new_fil2.txt, 
        new_dir {
            new_file1.txt, 
            new_file2.txt
            }
        }; 
    fail: any failed commands, any missing files in WD 
}
