Acceptance Test
Level 2: add, commit, checkout

Test 2a

$touch new_file1.txt
$touch new_file2.txt

$[executable_path] add new_file1.txt
$[executable_path] commit "first commit"
    -> checkpoint: receive id [first_commit_id] of this commit
$[executable_path] commit "another commit"
    -> checkpoint: expected to fail and return no change
$[executable_path] add new_file2.txt
$[executable_path] commit "second commit"
$[executable_path] checkout [first_commit_id] -b new_branch
    -> TEST_RESULT: {
        pass: WD only has new_file.txt and doesn't have new_file2.txt;

        fail: any failed checkpoints, new_file2.txt still exists, any other added or missing files from wd
    }

----------------

Test 2b

(this test is to immediately follow 2a and assumes the same WD and REPO condition after passing 2a)

$[executable_path] checkout main
    -> checkpoint: fail if new_file2.txt is not back in WD
$mkdir new_dir 
$cd new_dir
$touch new_file1.txt
$touch new_file2.txt

$[executable_path] add new_file.txt
    -> checkpoint: should add file despite repo in parent dir
$cd ..
$[executable_path] add new_dir/new_file2.txt
$[executable_path] commit 2b

    -> TEST_RESULT: {
        pass: all commands successful, wd has {
            new_file1.txt, 
            new_file2.txt, 
            new_dir {
                new_file1.txt, 
                new_file2.txt
                }
            }; (note: these empty files are considered identical in content and resulting in only one entry in the repo's file storage.)
        fail: any failed commands, any missing files in WD 
    }
