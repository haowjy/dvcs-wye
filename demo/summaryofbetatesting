Thanks to the beta testing Result of Arain, Baris, Boyang, Kayla, Owen, Xu

Q: 1b. N/A we handled the test differently, for a given file path that doesn't exist. It creates a path there instead of saying the path doesn't exist
A: We only chack path in init, not create. Although we have the function of create directory in dsr module
Similar: 1b and 3b, different design or parameters

Q:Test 3b : it is not a fail but is it the command "cat a.txt" should be "cat [revID] a.txt"?
A: Yes, it is "cat [revID] a.txt"

Q:4a: testing remove
test case:
mkdir test4a
cd test4a
./dvcs_wye init
touch file.txt
./dvcs_wye add file.txt
./dvcs_wye status ----- Error here
Error Message:
./dvcs-wye status
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ErrIo(Custom { kind: UnexpectedEof, error: "read_file_as_string: unknown error when reading file" })', src/cmd_interface/readonly.rs:104:50
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
A: not sure, recurrent but works will maybe because I use dvcs-wye add file.txt?

Q: 3b. status on non repo directory gives a core dump:
thread 'main' has overflowed its stack
fatal runtime error: stack overflow
Aborted (core dumped)
A: Have been fixed.

Q:4a. remove, removes the file from tracking. also gives this message:
Null current head
A: maybe because we only have head after commit? And no matter one file is track or untrack?

Q:5b. file deleted after checking out the merged branch
A:??fix or it is a bug

Q:7a. push gives error: push failed: wd and remote do not have the same working directory name, either rename working directory or use a different directory
after renaming the directory and changing directory to another directory it is still not resolved

7b. push gives error: push failed: wd and remote do not have the same working directory name, either rename working directory or use a different directory
after renaming the directory and changing directory to another directory it is still not resolved
A: idk
