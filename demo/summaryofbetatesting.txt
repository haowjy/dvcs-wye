Thanks to the beta testing Result of Arain, Baris, Boyang, Jinchen, Kayla, Owen, Xu, Ziqi

Q: 1b. N/A we handled the test differently, for a given file path that doesn't exist. It creates a path there instead of saying the path doesn't exist
A: We only chack path in init, not create. Although we have the function of create directory in dsr module
Similar: 1b and 3b, different design or parameters

Q:Test 3b : it is not a fail but is it the command "cat a.txt" should be "cat [revID] a.txt"?
A: Yes, it is "cat [revID] a.txt"

Q:4a: testing remove
test case:
mkdir test4a
cd test4a
./dvcs_wye init
touch file.txt
./dvcs_wye add file.txt
./dvcs_wye status ----- Error here
Error Message:
./dvcs-wye status
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ErrIo(Custom { kind: UnexpectedEof, error: "read_file_as_string: unknown error when reading file" })', src/cmd_interface/readonly.rs:104:50
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
A: not sure, recurrent but works will maybe because I use dvcs-wye add file.txt?

Q: 3b. status on non repo directory gives a core dump:
thread 'main' has overflowed its stack
fatal runtime error: stack overflow
Aborted (core dumped)
A: Have been fixed.

Q:4a. remove, removes the file from tracking. also gives this message:
Null current head
A: maybe because we only have head after commit? And no matter one file is track or untrack?

Similar: 4a: [dvcs remove c.txt] failed. This command is expected to remove c.txt from the tracking list, but c.txt is deleted from the working directory at the same time.

         4b: [dvcs remove b.txt] failed. This command is expected to remove b.txt from the tracking list, but b.txt is deleted from the working directory at the same time.

Similar:4a: "dvcs-wye remove c.txt" => Null current head (Requires commit before remove)
        4b: "dvcs-wye remove c.txt" => Unable to remove untracked file (But actually the file is removed from the tracking list)
A: different design?

Q:5a,5b  Not clear how to use this command, tried [dvcs merge [old version id]] and [dvcs merge [version id 1] [version id 2]], both failed. The first one says "No changes added to commit.", but there is changes between the same file of the old version and current version. The second one says "merge failed: uncommitted changes", but there are no uncommitted changes. This is due to the different understanding and design of branching and checkout.
Similar: merge failed: uncommitted changes (Changes happened and committed)
A:

Q:5b. file deleted after checking out the merged branch
A:??fix or it is a bug

Q:7a. push gives error: push failed: wd and remote do not have the same working directory name, either rename working directory or use a different directory
after renaming the directory and changing directory to another directory it is still not resolved

7b. push gives error: push failed: wd and remote do not have the same working directory name, either rename working directory or use a different directory
after renaming the directory and changing directory to another directory it is still not resolved
A: idk

Similar: 7b: [dvcs pull [remote path]] failed. There are one version in the current repository and two versions in the remote repository. After pulling from the remote repository, it says "pull failed: uncommitted changes in working directory, commit changes first", but there are no uncommitted changes in the working directory.
pull and push failed: wd and remote do not have the same working directory name
